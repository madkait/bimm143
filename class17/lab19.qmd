## Pertussis 

Pertussis,or whooping cough, is a highly contagious lung infection caused by the bacterium *B pertussis*

The cdc tracks reported cases from the 1920s. 

```{r}
cdc <- data.frame(

We can now plot the number of reported pertussis cases per year in the U.S.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(cdc) + 
  aes(Year, Cases) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1942, color = "blue", linetype=2) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1980, color = "grey", linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1992, color = "red", linetype=2)

```
The first big "whole-cell" pertussis vaccine program started in 1942; they changed the vaccine in 1992. 

Something big is happening with pertussis ccases and big outbreaks are once again a major public health concern! BUGGER

One of the main hypothesis for the increasing case numbers is waning vaccine efficiency with the newer aP vaccine. 

Enter the CMI-PB project, which is studying this problem on large scale.  Let's see what data they have. 

Their data is available in JSON format ("key:value" pair style).  We will use the "jsonlite" package to read their data.

```{r}
library(jsonlite)

subject <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/subject", simplifyVector = TRUE)

head(subject)
```
> Q4 How many aP and wP infancy vaccinated subjects are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$infancy_vac)
```

> Q5 How many Male and Female subjects are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$biological_sex)
```

> Q6 What is the breakdown of race and biological sex (e.g. number of Asian females, White males etc…)?

```{r}
table(subject$race, subject$biological_sex)
```

Now let's read some more database tables from CMI-PB: 

```{r}
specimen <- read_json("http://cmi-pb.org/api/specimen", simplifyVector = TRUE)
head(specimen)
```
I want to "join" (merge/link/etc.) the `subject` and `specimen` tables together.  I will use the **dplyr** package for this. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)

meta <- inner_join(subject, specimen)
head(meta)
```

```{r}
ab <- read_json("http://cmi-pb.org/api/ab_titer", simplifyVector = TRUE)
head(ab)
```

Now I can join "meta" that we made above and contains all info about the subjects and specimens with this `ab` data.

```{r}
abdata <- inner_join(meta, ab)

dim(abdata)
```
> Q11. How many specimens (i.e. entried in abdata) do we have for each isotype? 

```{r}
table(abdata$isotype)
```

> Q12 What do you notice about the number of visit 8 specimens compared to other visits? 

```{r}
table(abdata$visit)
```

There are way less visit 8 specimens because the project is still ongoing and we have not got that data for all individuals yet. 


## Examine IgG1 Ab titer levels 

We will use the `filter()` function from dplyr to focus on just IgG1 isotype and visits 1 to 7(i.e. exclude visits 8 as there are not many specimens there yet)


```{r}
ig1 <- abdata %>% filter(isotype == "IgG1", visit != 8)
#can also use filter(abdata, isotype == ...)

head(ig1)
```

Box plot of antigen levels over time. 

```{r}
ggplot(ig1) + 
  aes(MFI, antigen) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(vars(visit), nrow = 2)
```
Clearly FIM2/3 changes.  This is "Fimbrial protein" that makes the bacteria pilus and is involved in cell adhesion.  

PT Pertussus Toxin (what causes most of the damage)

FHA is a Flamentous hemagglutinin surface associated adherence protein of bacteria pertussis, which is a component of some new acellular pertussis vaccine. 

etc. 


Another version of this plot adds infancy_vac 
```{r}
ggplot(ig1) +
  aes(MFI, antigen, col=infancy_vac ) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(infancy_vac, visit), nrow=2)
```

Measels antigen levels per visit (aP red, wP teal)
```{r}
filter(ig1, antigen=="Measles") %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(MFI, col=infancy_vac) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(visit)) +
  theme_bw()
```

FIM2/3 antigen levels per visit (aP red, wP teal)
```{r}
filter(ig1, antigen=="FIM2/3") %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(MFI, col=infancy_vac) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(visit)) +
  theme_bw()
```
